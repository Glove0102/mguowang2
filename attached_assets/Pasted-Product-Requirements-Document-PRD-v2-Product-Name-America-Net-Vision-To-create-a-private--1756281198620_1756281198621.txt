Product Requirements Document (PRD) v2
Product Name: 美国网 (America Net)
Vision: To create a private, single-user portal that offers an authentic and immersive experience of an "American Internet," complete with a rich ecosystem of sub-sites, a rewarding progression system, and a consistent, believable world.
1. Core Principles (Non-Negotiable Rules)
These principles are the foundation of the project and must be strictly followed in all aspects of development, from UI text to backend logic.
* 1.1. Absolute Immersive Realism: The primary goal is to maintain the illusion that the portal and all its contents are real.
    * STRICTLY PROHIBITED: Do not include any language, hints, or disclaimers anywhere in the UI, text, content, or system prompts that suggest the portal, its features, or subsites are simulated, fake, "for fun," "for entertainment," or "for learning purposes." 
    * Example of Violation: A disclaimer on the Stock Trading page saying "This is a simulation." 
    * Correct Implementation: All features, such as stock trading, betting, and product listings, must be presented as genuine, functioning services. 
* 1.2. Consistent System Persona: All AI-generated content, including chat responses and news articles, must adopt a persona that reinforces the reality of the portal. The tone should be that of a helpful, authentic American service or friend, never an artificial assistant. 
* 1.3. User-Centric Design: The UI must be intuitive and styled after modern Chinese applications, ensuring a familiar and engaging experience for the target user. 
2. Tech Stack
* Frontend: React (basic routing, simple state management with Context or Redux if needed). 
* Backend: Node.js (Express) for API endpoints. 
* Database: PostgreSQL for dynamic data (user progress, balances, etc.). Static JSON files for mock content where possible. 
* Hosting: Replit deployment (built-in). 
3. High-Level Architecture
/client      (React frontend)
/server      (Node backend)
/data        (Static JSON for content)
/db          (Migrations & schema if using PostgreSQL)
/admin       (Admin panel code)
/subsites    (Each subsite = simple folder with route + template)

* Adding new sub-sites:
    * Create a folder under /subsites/. 
    * Register the new sub-site in /routes.js for navigation and to assign XP/$ rewards. 
4. Core Features
4.1 Onboarding
* The sign-up flow leads to a pre-configured user account. 
* Language selector defaults to Simplified Chinese. 
* A simple password gate (hardcoded) blocks unauthorized access. 
4.2 User System

4.3 Virtual Dollars & XP
* Earning: Visiting pages, reading articles, playing games, stock trading, and winning the lottery. 
* Spending: Lottery tickets, dating gifts, and premium creator content.
